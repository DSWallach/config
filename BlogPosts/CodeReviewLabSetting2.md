# Code Review in a Lab Setting

## What is Code Review?
If you work at a software company you already know what this is, but you may not be familiar if you're just starting out. Code review is essentially a process for maintaining a certain standard of code within a repository. My examples will be based of work-flows that use git but it can be applied to other types of version control. Before any changes can be merged into the master branch, another developer working on the repository must check the changes, make sure they are properly tested and fit the repository style before approving the pull request. This accomplishes two things. It ensures a certain level of code quality but it also ensures that other people working on the project will be familiar with the changes.
