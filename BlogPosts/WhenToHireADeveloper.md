## When to hire a developer

Much of the scientific research conducted today relies on computational tools and analysis. For labs looking to pursue such research must face an important question. Who to hire to develop or use these tools. I can only speak for Genetics research labs but in my experience the majority of the interested applicants come from Biological science backgrounds, usually with decent wet lab experience but limited computational skills. Are these applicants suitable for the tasks you have in mind?

## What are the differences

The short, unhelpful answer is maybe. It depends on the applicant and time frame of the position. Programming is not some dark art that requires special knowledge granted only to those with computer science degrees. I think it is among the most easily assessable academic fields, all someone really needs to learn is a computer with an internet connection. Assuming that the applicant is reasonably intelligent they will likely be able to develop the skills you require on the job. This will take time though. Every will be slow at first because they will have to learn how to do each task before actually implementing it. This can be a serious issue particularly in research labs where turn over tends to be high relative to most private companies.

## SOME TRANSITIONAL THING

The bigger issue, I think, is not speed of development, but quality of the final product. There is a lot of poorly written scientific software out there. This might not immediately seem like an issue "If it runs, it runs" after all. I think it's a more significant problem than many people realize. Part of the scientific process is peer-review, it has its issues but it does promote higher quality research. Proper peer review of software would require the reviewer to have knowledge at least on par with that of an average software developer. This is not the case. Most of the reviewers will come from wet lab research backgrounds, they will be PhDs not engineers. Since external quality control is limited it is up to the individual labs to push internally to release a high quality product.

## Pros to CS

Hiring a CS graduate is not a guarantee you will get someone who cares about code quality. Most courses will require tests, commenting, and other standards but these are externally motivated. In my experience it is not until a programmer has had to work with low quality code that they really understand the importance of writing quality code. There are plenty of books and articles written about unit testing, design patterns, and modular design but these are decidedly less sexy topics than machine learning, cloud computing, or what ever the latest buzzword is. It is an indication however that they will at least be familiar with what good practices are, whether or not they follow them.

## Cons to CS

There are downsides to developers however. First and foremost they are hard to come by. The plethora of start ups and technology companies mean that demand for skilled programmers drastically outstrips supply. Due to this they also tend to require higher salaries than would typically be paid to a Post-Doc or standard lab technician. They will also likely require training in the details of your particular research field, unless they've previously held a position in a similar lab.
